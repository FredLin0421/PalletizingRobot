# Palletizing Robot Design

## Background : Palletizing Robot
- Can handle up to 1000 kg
- Can minimize the uses of the space
- High precision control and cycle time
### Mechanical Design
We first design the mechanism of the entire robot system, including the frames, robot arms, and gripper.

### Mechatronic System
The mechatronic system consist of 4 AC servo motors, 4 reducers, controller, pneumatic gripper, transformer, etc.

## Taiwan Robot Competition 2016
The aim of our project is to participate the competition. We built a 4-axises palletizing robot and are able to handle the payloads up to 5 kg. We were given four tasks during the competition, such as cycle time challenge, precision and speed, grasping and stacking. In the end, our robot was awarded the 2nd place based on the overall performance of our robot. I was selected to be an operator for the robot competition. Belows are some pictures during the competition.
