# Palletizing Robot Design

## Background : Palletizing Robot
- Can handle up to 1000 kg
- Can minimize the uses of the space
- High precision control and cycle time
### Mechanical Design
We first design the mechanism of the entire robot system, including the frames, robot arms, and gripper.

### Mechatronic System
The mechatronic system consist of 4 AC servo motors, 4 reducers, controller, pneumatic gripper, transformer, etc.  
The motors(two 400W,one 200W,one 100W) was chosen to be control our palletizing robot. Moreover, in order to increase the torque of the motor, we then introduced the reducers.

## Taiwan Robot Competition 2016
The aim of our project is to participate the competition in the nation. We built a 4 axis palletizing robot and are able to handle the payloads up to 5 kg. The competition
